# Greenify-Documentation

Greenify is a project that has a primary goal to promote the ecotourism sector in Indonesia. Tourism industry in Indonesia has been increasing significantly in the last few years. According to the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy of Indonesia, the number of foreign tourist arrivals in Indonesia who visited ecotourism destinations increased by 35.1% in 2019 (16 million tourists), compared to the previous year. The Indonesian government has set a target to achieve 20 million foreign tourist arrivals by 2024, with a focus on promoting sustainable tourism practices. Eventually, this growth also comes with environmental degradation and induces negative side effects to local residents. With that urgency in mind, our project comes to overcome this problem because we have a meaningful, long-term purpose to give information to the tourists regarding accommodation, tours, and other activities that are environmentally-friendly in all over Indonesia. To overcome this problem, we’ll make a mobile-based sustainable tourism application which will have a recommender system who recommends destination areas who are eco-friendly and who are concerned much about green footprint and the life of local residents nearby.
